# Norwegian 10 finger typing

I had recently bought a new mechanical keyboard and tried some typing speed test. One of these online tests showed where to place your fingers while typing. And I quickly learned that I was using only 5-6 fingers while typing. I wanted to learn it properly, but couldn't find any online tool that showed how to position fingers on a norwegian keyboard layout. Thus this project came to life.
